    "### CONCLUSION:\n",
    "\n",
    "We are able to successfully tracked these two events `purchasing a sword and joining guild` from the moment request was made to what happend in the pipelines. We controlled the streaming from sword purchases by `10 mins` and join guild by `15`mins. This is so because more people make purchases than join guilds. Using Apache bench, we generate events and send to kafka. This events are stored in `hdfs` using `readstream` option from `kafka`. This allows for continuosly streaming events and storing into `hdfs`. To examine what is in the `hdfs`, we used `hive metastore -the hard-way` to register events in a table and query using presto.\n",
